# Mod Fixer
This is used primarily for Hypixel Skyblock for fixing mods that won't work, if some mods are incompatible with eachother this can make them compatible!

#Why is this useful?
If you have 2 conflicting (useful) mods you want to work together you can run this and insert the mod you want to fix!

# How does it work?
When ran it will give you the prompt of import and export, you will press import and select the mod you want to fix, when you are done type "done" it will bring you back to the homepage and you can press export and it will fix the mod!

# Why does it get flagged
It may get flagged because I didn't want to buy a fancy certificate from Microsoft and because it has to have access to read the .jar (mod file)
